# OpenPocket host tests (Linux / macOS, or in the container: tools/op.mjs test; no pedal, no JieLi toolchain needed):
#   tests/run_tests.sh [PocketX_016.fwsc]
#  - engine: every block x model x extreme knob, signal / silence / overload, with the pedal's own libm (px_math.c):
#    no NaN; long runs (3 s pluck + 8 s silence): nothing runs away (only delays at FDBK 100 hold on, by design)
#  - preset store: save / reload / power cut at every step of a save (firmware/px_store.h on a simulated flash)
#  - packages: tools/pxpkg.py rebuilds the official PocketX_016 app area byte for byte (needs the official file)
#  - installer: docs/pxota.js + docs/pxpkg.js against a simulated pedal running the real update code (ota.c, ldr_core.c)
#  - flasher: tools/flash.mjs (node tools/op.mjs flash) against the same simulated pedal: update, dry run, wrong model, damaged package, rescue of a pedal that restarts in a loop
#  - hosted simulator: tools/sim.mjs driven over HTTP (controls, held buttons, screen, flash file, SysEx, the Web MIDI shim)
#  - pedal skin: its input mapping (tools/sim/pedal-input.js)
#  - sound: the WebAssembly engine on known signals, against the native build; the bundled loops against their manifest
#  - pages: docs/index.html, docs/editor.html and the pedal skin in headless Chromium (needs Playwright: npm i playwright
#    && npx playwright install chromium)
