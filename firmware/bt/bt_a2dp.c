/* The Bluetooth audio test image (build target "bt", docs/BT-AUDIO-TEST.md): JieLi's classic controller and host (the stock
 * firmware's own, third_party/jieli-ble + third_party/jieli-bt) are started; the pedal shows up on a phone as "OpenPocket", pairs
 * with no PIN (Just Works) and plays the phone's music into its output (A2DP sink, SBC, mono).
 *
 * The image is the Bluetooth test image's (OP_BLE_TEST: ble/ble_os.c's scheduler, the radio start-up, the stall watch, the boot
 * report, DIAG) with the classic stack in place of the LE one: openpocket.c calls the same ble_test_* functions, defined here.
 *
 *   start   an app task ("btapp") runs btstack_init (it waits for the controller), then sends the stack's commands
 *   events  bt_event_notify (the stack calls it): ready -> visible and connectable; connected; media start / stop
 *   audio   the controller shows every media packet to the A2DP code before it chooses between the app and the host; there
 *           (a2dp_media_packet_user_handler) each one is copied into a FIFO (test build 12: the library's own choice failed
 *           from the second packet of each session). The main loop (ble_test_poll) decodes the FIFO's SBC frames (bt_sbc.c)
 *           into the ring (px_bt_ring.h) and steers its rate; px_audio.h dsp_out adds the ring to the output */
