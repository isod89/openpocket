 * over the 52 presets with a guitar playing: within 0.06 ms, 0.2 ms on ORGAN) since v42 keeps the callbacks' order
 * (px_aorder.h). felucca-bsp's own figures (a band of 80 to 128, primed at 104, and a target of 256) allow for a render
 * that starts up to 0.7 ms late and held 1.6 ms more than the pedal needs. Measured with these: the record ring's fill at
 * a block's write 38 to 121 frames, the playback ring's at a block's read 167 to 251 (it needs 130).
 * The margin left, with the two clocks up to 300 ppm apart either way (tests/test_usb_audio.c): 0.6 ms (26 frames)
 * and more. The record ring takes a block that comes that much later than the one before (an effect switched on), the
 * playback ring one that comes that much sooner (switched off); beyond it a few frames are held or the ring is primed
 * again, as at a preset change. */
