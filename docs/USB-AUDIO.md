# USB audio: the pedal as a sound card (v42)

With the **USB AUDIO** setting on, the pedal is a USB sound card as well as a USB-MIDI device. A computer records the
pedal's sound over the USB-C cable, and what the computer plays comes out of the pedal's output and headphones. The
pedal is class compliant (USB Audio Class 1): macOS, Windows, iOS and iPadOS use it without a driver.

The setting is **off by default**. With it off the pedal is on USB exactly what it was before: the same USB device,
byte for byte, with MIDI alone.

## Using it

**Switch it on**, either way:

- On the pedal: hold **FX** for 0.8 s to open the MIDI page, press PUSH three times to reach **USB AUDIO**, turn the
  knob to **ON**, press HOME.
- In the web editor: **USB audio**, **Turn on**.

The pedal saves the setting (the sound stops for about 0.3 s, as for SAVE), leaves USB for one second and comes back
as a device named **OpenPocket** with an audio input, an audio output and the MIDI port. The setting is kept through
power cycles and firmware updates. The web editor connects again by itself; the installer and firmware updates work the
same with the setting on or off.

**Record the pedal.** Choose the input **OpenPocket** in the recording program, at 44.1 kHz. Both channels carry the
same signal: the pedal's sound after the whole effect chain. The level is the one the output has with MASTER at 100, so
the MASTER knob does not change the recording, and the tuner's mute is in it.

**Play through the pedal.** Choose the output **OpenPocket**. The computer's sound, in stereo, is added to the pedal's
own at the output, so you hear a backing track and your guitar together in the headphones. MASTER sets the level of
both. The balance between them is set with the volume of the playing program, because the pedal offers the computer
no volume control of its own (some systems then grey out their volume slider for the device). What the computer plays
is not in the recording.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Format | 2 channels, 16 bit, 44.1 kHz, both ways. Only this rate: set the project or the device to 44.1 kHz |
| Record | the pedal's sound on both channels; delay from the output block to the cable about 1 to 5.5 ms |
| Playback | stereo; delay from the cable to the output block about 5 ms |
| USB | full speed (USB 1.1 rates), one isochronous endpoint each way, beside the MIDI endpoints |

**What to expect.**

- A change of an effect's type, of the block order or of the NAM model, a preset change and a save silence the pedal
  for a few milliseconds, as before. The recording has the same silence.
- The pedal's clock is its own (44,117.6 Hz, as the stock firmware's). The computer follows it when it records, and the
  pedal follows the computer when it plays. Nothing drifts apart over time; a recording made by another sound card at
  the same time is not sample-locked to it, as with any two sound cards.
- USB audio adds up to 1 point of DSP load while the computer records and up to 2 while it also plays (see "Cost"
  below). Nothing is added while no program uses the device, or with the setting off.
- The Bluetooth test image has no USB audio (its memory is full).

**If the computer does not see the device**, switch USB AUDIO off on the pedal's MIDI page: the pedal is then the plain
MIDI device again and the editor and installer reach it as before. Tested so far: macOS 26 on Apple silicon. Windows,
iOS, iPadOS, Linux and macOS 13 to 15 are not tested yet; the descriptors follow what felucca-bsp found those systems
to need (see below).

## How it works

### What was there

- **The chip.** The pedal's JieLi AC791N has one full-speed USB device controller with endpoint 0, three general
  endpoints and a fourth with its own DMA registers that can run isochronous transfers
  (`firmware/bsp/chip/fm1_usb.h`). The stock firmware uses it as a sound card: USB Audio Class 1, playback adaptive and
  record asynchronous, 2 channels, 24 bit, 44.1 kHz only, beside a MIDI interface ([STOCK-FIRMWARE.md](STOCK-FIRMWARE.md)
  13.2 and 15.2).
- **The USB code.** OpenPocket's USB device is felucca-bsp's `chip/usb.c` (MPL-2.0), written for the FM-1, which has the
  same chip. It already held both audio streams, switched off at build time: a record stream (`FELUCCA_UAC`) and a
  playback stream (`FELUCCA_UAC_OUT`), both on endpoint 4, 16 bit stereo, with rings, pacing and the descriptors, and
  the notes of what macOS needs of them. OpenPocket had built it with MIDI alone.

So the feature is felucca-bsp's streams switched on, a setting, and the pedal's side of the audio.

### The smallest design

- **The streams** are felucca-bsp's as they are: endpoint 4 IN, isochronous asynchronous, for the record stream;
  endpoint 4 OUT, isochronous adaptive, for playback; 16 bit, 2 channels, 44.1 kHz, one packet a millisecond. No 48 kHz:
  it needs a resampler in the audio interrupt, and the stock firmware offers 44.1 kHz only too.
- **The interfaces** are in the order audio control, record stream, playback stream, MIDI
  (`FELUCCA_UAC_MIDI_LAST 1`). felucca-bsp found that macOS 13 to 15 show no audio device when the MIDI interface comes
  before the streams.
- **The setting** switches the descriptors at run time (`FELUCCA_UAC_SWITCH`, added to `usb.c` for OpenPocket, after
  its `usb_cdc_switch`): off, the pedal presents the descriptors of a build without audio, with `bcdDevice` 3.00; on,
  the audio device, with `bcdDevice` 3.D0, so a computer does not reuse what it learnt about the other one. A change
  takes the pedal off the bus for one second. The setting is one bit in the preset store's header
  (`firmware/px_store.h`, the header's second spare byte; every earlier firmware wrote 0 there, which is off). At boot
  the store is now read before the USB device starts, so the computer finds the right device from its first question.
- **The pedal's side** is `firmware/px_uaudio.h`. Once a block, in the I2S interrupt on CPU0, where the block the second
  core made is complete (`a_dec`), `px_ua_block` writes the block into the record ring and adds the playback to the
  output. USB's own work (taking and sending the packets) stays in the 2 kHz USB poll that MIDI already uses.
- **What is recorded** is the chain's output after the mutes and the change fade and before MASTER, through the
  output's soft knee, as 16 bits on both channels.
- **Playback** is added after MASTER has been applied to the pedal's sound, at MASTER's gain, and the sum is clipped
  to the output's 24 bits.

### The two clocks

The pedal's sample clock comes from its own crystal: 6 MHz / 136 = 44,117.647 Hz. USB's millisecond comes from the
computer. They are not locked, so neither side may assume 44.1 frames a millisecond.

- **Record (asynchronous endpoint):** the pedal is the clock. Each packet carries the frames the pedal's clock made in
  that millisecond: 44, and 45 every 8.5th packet. A ring of 512 frames lies between the audio interrupt, which writes
  128 frames every 2.9 ms, and the USB poll, which reads a packet a millisecond. What is left of the difference between
  the two crystals is steered by the ring's fill: when the fill at a block's write leaves the band of 52 to 108 frames,
  one packet is made a frame longer or shorter, at most once a block. The computer measures the rate it receives and
  follows it.
- **Playback (adaptive endpoint):** the computer is the clock. Its packets go into a ring of 1,024 frames, and the audio
  interrupt reads them resampled to the pedal's clock (linear interpolation). The ring's fill at a block's read, aimed
  at 208 frames, steers the ratio by at most 0.6 %.
- **The figures** are in `firmware/px_uaconf.h`. A block is written and read at the moment its sound is ready, 0.3 to
  2.5 ms after the audio interrupt starts, by the preset. Within a preset that moment is steady (within 0.06 ms over the
  52 presets with a guitar playing, 0.2 ms on ORGAN), so the rings need to hold a packet's worth of phase and a margin,
  and no more: the record ring's fill at a write measures 38 to 121 frames, the playback ring's at a read 167 to 251 (it
  needs 130). The margin left is 0.6 ms and more with the two clocks 300 ppm apart either way.

### The order of the audio callbacks

The first USB audio builds clicked while a computer had a stream open: about once or twice a second, at the pedal's
output as well as in the recording. The streams were not the cause; they made an older fault frequent. It is mended
in v42, for every use of the pedal.

- **What happened.** Each audio interrupt has two callbacks of JieLi's I2S driver: one hands over the guitar's block,
  the other asks for the output block. The output block must be the sound made from that guitar block, so the first
  must run first, and normally it does: the input's block ends a few microseconds before the output's, the interrupt
  enters with the input alone pending, and enters again for the output. The driver serves the output's channel before
  the input's, though. When the interrupt enters a little late, both are pending, the output is asked for first, and
  the pedal sent the block before once more; the block made right after was never sent. One block of 2.9 ms twice and
  one lost: a click.
- **Why with USB audio.** The interrupt enters late when the USB poll's, which has priority, runs at that moment. With
  no stream the poll is short. With a stream it builds or takes a packet every millisecond (up to 40 us), and the order
  turned about 1.7 times a second with one stream and 3.4 times with both. MIDI and the editor's messages lengthen the
  poll as well, so the same click could come without USB audio, far less often.
- **The fix** (`firmware/px_aorder.h`): an output block asked for before its guitar block is only noted; the guitar
  block's callback, which follows within microseconds, fills it once the sound is started. The sound is then the same
  as in the usual order. `USB_AUDIO`'s count 20 says how often it happened.
- **Measured** on a BlackBox, a synthetic guitar playing, the computer recording the pedal's sound: a block of the
  recording that equals the 128 frames before it, sample for sample, is a block sent twice.

| | Blocks sent twice, before | After | Orders turned and put right, after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC15 CHIME (factory preset 1, load 68 %) | 199 in 120 s (99 a minute) | 0 in 300 s | 494 |
| Worst-case chain (a NAM amp, all 12 blocks on, load 83 %) | 147 in 120 s (74 a minute) | 0 in 300 s | 511 |

  The streams themselves were whole before and after: a sine played by the computer came back from the pedal without
  a break (120 s, each preset) and no ring ran empty or full; on a v40 build with the same change, a counter in the
  record stream arrived without a break (7.9 million frames, each preset).
- **The rings after it.** With the order kept the rings hold less than felucca-bsp's own figures (a band of 80 to 128
  and a target of 256, for a render that may start late): the way from the computer through the pedal and back, the
  pedal handing the playback straight to the record stream, measured 12.7 ms with those and 11.1 ms with the pedal's,
  by the computer's time stamps. A playback stream opened again starts empty, not with the last 5 ms of the stream
  before, which the ring still held.

### With USB AUDIO off

- The USB descriptors are those of the firmware before, byte for byte (`tests/test_usb_audio.c` reads them through the
  real control-transfer code and compares them with a build without audio).
- Requests for the streams are refused as before, endpoint 4 is not set up, and nothing is ever queued on it.
- The audio interrupt tests one flag a block. The loads it measures are computed as before.
- The engine is not touched: `tests/equiv.sh` against the base gives identical output on its 852 runs.

### Cost

Measured on a BlackBox with the release image. The first figure is the time `px_ua_block` takes in the audio interrupt
on CPU0, as a share of an audio block (2.9 ms). The second is the change of the load the pedal reports (the busier
core's, in points) against the base firmware, over the 11 worst-case chains of the DSP work (a NAM amp, all 12 blocks
on, every knob at 100) and over the 23 factory presets with an amp. It also holds the USB poll's extra work.

| | In the audio interrupt | Load, 11 worst-case chains | Load, factory presets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Setting off | one flag tested | 0.0 to +0.6 (mean +0.2), the spread between two runs | -1 to +1 (mean 0.0) |
| On, no program using the device | 0.01 % | not measured apart | not measured apart |
| The computer records | 0.42 % | -0.5 to +1.0 (mean +0.6) | 0 to +2 (mean +0.4) |
| The computer records and plays | 1.16 % (playing alone: about 0.75 %) | -0.4 to +2.0 (mean +1.3) | 0 to +2 (mean +1.2) |

No chain engaged the safety bypass (above 93 % for 8 blocks) and no block was late, also with a synthetic guitar at
the input, which costs more than a quiet one. The heaviest chain, W4, went from 82.4 % to 83.4 % with both streams
(83.8 % with the synthetic guitar, its highest single block 92 %).

With a NAM amp the two cores share the network so that both are equally busy; the time USB audio takes on CPU0 is
part of what the sharing balances.

Memory: 6.7 KB of RAM (the record ring 2 KB, the playback ring 4 KB, two packet buffers and the counters), 0.4 KB of RAM
code.

### Limits, and what is not done

- 16 bit, 44.1 kHz only. The stock firmware sends 24 bit; felucca-bsp's streams are 16 bit and were kept as they are.
- The recording is mono on both channels (the engine is mono). A dry guitar on the second channel for reamping in the
  computer, and playing the computer's sound into the effect chain, are not done.
- No volume or mute control is offered to the computer.
- A full change, a preset change and a save leave a short silence in the recording, and the record ring is primed
  again after it (about 2 ms of extra silence).
- A recording program that stops reading without closing the stream makes the pedal drop blocks for 20 ms before it
  stops feeding the ring. Nothing is heard: nobody is reading.
- An effect switched on or off moves the moment a block is ready. Up to 0.6 ms the rings take it; beyond that the
  record stream holds a few frames or the playback is primed again (a few milliseconds of it missing), once.
- macOS, about a second after a program has opened both streams, sometimes leaves one USB frame without asking for a
  record packet (the pedal counts it, `USB_AUDIO`'s count 18). For about half a second its recording then holds short
  pieces of what it recorded a quarter second earlier (up to 65 frames in every 512; measured: each piece is an exact
  copy of the recording 11,025 frames before it). They are made in the computer, not in the pedal's packets.

## Tests

- `tests/test_usb_audio.c` (in `tests/run_tests.sh`): `usb.c` and `px_uaudio.h` on a PC against a model of the USB
  controller and of a computer. It checks the descriptors and the requests with the setting off and on, the switch,
  the recording's level and soft knee, the playback's level, clipping and mute, a playback stream opened again, and
  10 minutes of each stream with the pedal's clock 300 ppm fast and slow against the computer's: every frame arrives
  once and in order, and the rings keep 0.6 ms in hand.
- `tests/test_aorder.c`: the audio callbacks in either order (`firmware/px_aorder.h`): every output block is the sound
  of its own interrupt's guitar block.
- `tests/test_store.c`: the setting survives a power cycle and a preset save; an older store reads as off.
- `tests/test_editor.mjs`, `tests/test_editor_page.mjs`: `USB_AUDIO` on the simulated pedal, the editor's button.
- `tests/uisim.c`: the MIDI page's fourth row.
- On a pedal: the editor's `USB_AUDIO` command gives the streams' counts ([EDITOR-PROTOCOL.md](EDITOR-PROTOCOL.md));
  the record ring's "empty" and "no packet ready" counts must not rise while a preset simply plays.
- Measurements on a pedal: a build with `OP_UADEV 1` (`firmware/base/audio.h`, never a release) adds the timing of the
  audio callbacks and the rings' fills to `USB_AUDIO`'s reply, and can put a counter or the computer's playback in the
  record stream, a steady tone at the input, and the callbacks' old order back, each switched by `USB_AUDIO`'s argument
  (`firmware/px_uaudio.h`). The figures of "The order of the audio callbacks" were taken with it.
