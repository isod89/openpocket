# LOW OCTAVE and SYN PAD: the Bluetooth audio image's own effects

Two effects that only the **Bluetooth audio image** has ([BT-AUDIO-TEST.md](BT-AUDIO-TEST.md), `make bt`). The release
firmware, the BLE MIDI image and the simulator do not have them: their engine is v42's, unchanged.

| Block | Model | Settings | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| PIT | LOW OCTAVE (the 6th) | RANGE, OCT -1, DRY, GROWL, COMP | an octave under the low notes only, the rest of the guitar untouched |
| SYN | PAD (the 12th) | ATTACK, RELEASE, TONE, MOTION, MIX | the chord you catch on the left footswitch, held as a smooth pad until the next one |

Both come after their block's other models, so every preset keeps its meaning. A preset saved with one of them plays
something else in the other images: there LOW OCTAVE becomes OCTAVER and PAD becomes ORGAN, with the same knob values (and a
pedal running them refuses such a preset from the web editor). Over MIDI, the Control Change that picks PIT's model (54)
divides 0-127 among 6 models in this image and 5 in the others, and SYN's (63) among 12 and 11, so a value stored in a
controller may pick a different model in each image ([MIDI.md](MIDI.md)).

The web editor shows both, with their settings in plain values: it reads the models from the pedal. It keeps each
firmware's list under the version the pedal reports, so this image reports `v42 FX` (the editor's status line shows it),
and the editor asks for its list instead of reusing the one of a v42 pedal it met before.

## LOW OCTAVE

An octave under the low notes, the rest of the guitar untouched, as the OC-3's and OC-5's POLY modes. RANGE shows the note
where it stops: `A2` (20) the E string up to the 4th fret, `D3` (40) the E and A strings in open position, up to `G4` (100)
(the table below). Of two notes below RANGE the lower one gets the octave, as a bass player would play the root of a power
chord (clean: 96-99 % of the octave on it). RANGE at 0 is `LOWEST`, as on the OC-5: the octave of the lowest note of any
chord, anywhere on the neck. OCT -1 at 50 plays the octave as loud as the note. DRY 100 leaves your signal exactly as it is
(the block switched off gives the same samples). GROWL drives the octave alone through a soft clipper, as the OC-3's DRIVE
mode, so that it carries on small speakers and a PA without subwoofers; at 0 the octave stays clean. COMP evens the
octave's level, as a compressor in front of an octaver: at 100 a note 20 dB softer gets an octave only 2 dB softer, and the
hum between notes is not raised.

The octave comes about 14 ms after the note (the dry signal has no delay): it is made from the note's phase, turned half as
fast, so nothing waits in a buffer; the time is the filters' that pick the note. The low band runs at 5.5 kHz. It splits by
pitch, not by string: a note below RANGE gets the octave on whatever string you play it.

Where the octave reaches on the neck, in standard tuning (a note right at the value shown gets it about 3 dB softer, a
whole tone above about 12 dB softer: the edge is soft):

| RANGE | Screen | Crossover | Gets the octave |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| 0 | `LOWEST` | 600 Hz | the lowest note of any chord, anywhere on the neck |
| 1 | `D#2` | 80 Hz | the open low E (a little softer) |
| 10 | `F#2` | 93 Hz | E 0-2 |
| 20 | `A2` | 109 Hz | E 0-4 (the 5th fret and the open A softer) |
| 25 | `A#2` | 118 Hz | E 0-6, A 0-1 |
| 33 | `C3` | 135 Hz | E 0-8, A 0-3 |
| 40 | `D3` | 151 Hz | E 0-10, A 0-5, the open D softer |
| 50 | `F3` | 177 Hz | E 0-13, A 0-8, D 0-3 |
| 60 | `G#3` | 209 Hz | E 0-16, A 0-11, D 0-6, G 0-1 |
| 70 | `B3` | 246 Hz | E 0-18, A 0-13, D 0-8, G 0-3 |
| 80 | `D4` | 289 Hz | E 0-21, A 0-16, D 0-11, G 0-6, B 0-2 |
| 100 | `G4` | 400 Hz | E, A, D up to the 17th fret, G 0-12, B 0-8, e 0-3 |

What the other settings show:

| Setting | Screen |
|---|---|
| OCT -1 | the octave's level against the note: `OFF` at 0, `-6 DB` at 25, `0 DB` at 50, `+3 DB` at 70, `+6 DB` at 100 |
| DRY | your signal's level: `OFF` at 0, `-6 DB` at 50, `0 DB` at 100 (untouched) |
| GROWL | the drive into its clipper: `OFF` at 0, `+11 DB` at 10, `+19 DB` at 33, `+22 DB` at 50, `+28 DB` at 100 |
| COMP | the compression ratio: `OFF` at 0, `1.4:1` at 33, `1.8:1` at 50, `3.6:1` at 80, `10:1` at 100 (a note 20 dB softer gets an octave 2 dB softer) |

Settings to start from. They depend on what reproduces the bass and on the pickup, so tune them by ear (they were worked out
on paper and with recordings, not yet on a stage):

| Situation | RANGE | OCT -1 | DRY | GROWL | COMP | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PA or amp with a subwoofer | `D3` (40) | `0 DB` (50) | `0 DB` (100) | `OFF` | `1.4:1` (33) | the octave's fundamental (41 Hz under a low E) comes out: keep it a clean sine |
| No subwoofer: small PA, combo amp, stage monitor | `D3` (40) | `+3 DB` (70) | `0 DB` (100) | `+19 DB` (33) to `+22 DB` (50) | `1.8:1` (50) | 41 Hz barely leaves a 10-12" speaker: GROWL's harmonics (3, 5 times the octave) let the ear hear it |
| Headphones, in-ear monitors | `D3` (40) | `0 DB` (50) | `0 DB` (100) | `OFF` | `1.4:1` (33) | they reproduce the sub; GROWL only for the sound |
| Piezo pickup (acoustic) | `C3` (33) | `-2 DB` (40) | `0 DB` (100) | `OFF` | `2.7:1` (70) | a piezo booms in the lows and slaps hard: a lower RANGE keeps the boom out, more COMP evens the slaps |
| Magnetic pickup (electric, or a soundhole pickup) | `D3` (40) to `F3` (50) | `0 DB` (50) | `0 DB` (100) | to taste | `1.6:1` (40) | an even low end: little COMP needed |
| Bass line that moves up the neck under chords | `LOWEST` (0) | `0 DB` (50) | `0 DB` (100) | as above | as above | the octave follows the lowest note wherever it is |

## SYN PAD

A smooth chord held under your playing, for as long as you want. Strum a chord and press the **left footswitch** (or press
it, then strum: it waits for the strum and skips the pick): the pad catches 0.37 s of the ringing chord and swells it in over
ATTACK, then holds it, steady, while you play over it. Press again on the next chord: the pad crosses over to it over the
same ATTACK. **Hold** the footswitch 0.7 s to let the pad fade out over RELEASE. Your guitar itself goes through untouched.
The pad plays the chord as your guitar sounded it (it is not an oscillator): a clean or lightly driven tone in front of it
gives the smoothest pad. It runs at 5.5 kHz in the synth block's own memory.

**The footswitches.** While the preset has a PAD on, the left footswitch is the pad's and no longer steps back a preset
(the right one still steps forward); a catch never changes the preset's settings or the page you are on. Both footswitches
together still open the tuner, as in v42: left then right within 0.15 s opens it and lets the pad go; right then left is
v42's (the step back, then the tuner). On SAVE, MIDI, MOVE, the tuner and the diagnostics the left footswitch does what it
did before. With the PAD off, or another SYN model, the left footswitch is the previous preset, as always.

**A MIDI footswitch** can catch the chord too: Control Change 64 (sustain) at 64 or more, with a PAD on in the preset; 0 to
63 does nothing. It catches on every page, as the footswitch did on v40.

| Setting | Screen | What it sets |
|---|---|---|
| ATTACK | `0.1 S` (0) to `6.0 S` (100); `1.0 S` at 40, `1.6 S` at 50, `3.0 S` at 70 | the swell, and the crossing into a new chord |
| RELEASE | `0.2 S` (0) to `10 S` (100); `1.8 S` at 40, `2.7 S` at 50, `5.0 S` at 70 | the fade when the footswitch is held |
| TONE | `300 HZ` (0) to `2400 HZ` (100); `690 HZ` at 40, `850 HZ` at 50, `1290 HZ` at 70 | dark to open |
| MOTION | `OFF` (0) to `15 CT` (100); `3 CT` at 20, `6 CT` at 40, `8 CT` at 50 | still, to a slow chorus (the grains' detune) |
| MIX | `OFF` (0), `-6 DB` (25), `0 DB` (50), `+3 DB` (70), `+6 DB` (100) | the pad's level; at `0 DB` about as loud as the chord |

Settings to start from (worked out from what the settings do, not yet tried on a stage):

| Situation | ATTACK | RELEASE | TONE | MOTION | MIX |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A chord held under a solo | `1.6 S` (50) | `2.7 S` (50) | `850 HZ` (50) | `6 CT` (40) | `0 DB` (50) |
| Slow swells, ambient | `3.0 S` (70) | `5.0 S` (70) | `690 HZ` (40) | `9 CT` (60) | `-3 DB` (35) |
| Following the song's chords | `0.3 S` (20) | `1.1 S` (30) | `1290 HZ` (70) | `3 CT` (20) | `0 DB` (50) |

## What they cost, and where it comes from

The Bluetooth image had almost no memory left (test build 14: 40 bytes free in the engine's own RAM region, the POOL, and
an estimated 1 to 4 KB in the RAM code window). The two effects are paid for inside that image only (`engine/px_dsp.h`
`PX_OWN_FX`, set by `firmware/build.sh` under `OP_BT`):

- **The same sound in less code.** The drive and delay code no model reaches is left out: the delay's generic loop (each
  delay type has its own), TAPE's and SPACE ECHO's loop without flutter (at WOW 0 the flutter is 0 and stays still), and
  the drive modes none of the four drives uses (and MUFF's buffer, 1 KB). Every existing model gives the same output, bit
  for bit (`tests/ownfx_equiv.sh`, 5,460 runs).
- **The delay ring 456 ticks shorter.** The effects' state (912 bytes) sits where the delay ring ended, so the engine keeps
  its size and every other part of it its place. The longest delay is still 2.0 s (TIME 100): every delay plays as before.
- Their hot code runs from RAM, like the rest of the audio path.

Estimates from a stand-in compiler (CI's build prints the real figures: `hi RAM`, `pool tail`, `RAM`): against test build
14, RAM code 3.3 to 4.1 KB less (the effects about +3.8 KB, the code left out about -7.1 KB) and the RAM code window's data
832 bytes less, so the window has 4 to 5 KB more free; the flash image about the same (the RAM code is stored in it too;
the flash code grows by about 3 KB); the POOL, the main RAM and NOINIT as before (40 bytes free in the POOL).

## On the pedal

Not measured yet: the CPU they take there, and the second core's stack. On a computer LOW OCTAVE costs less than POLY
OCTAVE (its low band runs every 8th sample) and a held PAD about as much as SITAR, the lightest SYN model; a PAD's catch
does its one-off work in a single block.

- `node tools/op.mjs dsp` with LOW OCTAVE (`LOWEST`, GROWL 100, COMP 100) in front of a NAM preset, the music playing: `DSP`
  and late blocks against the same preset without it.
- With a PAD on a non-NAM preset, after a catch: the log's c1 line, `K` (the second core's stack, of 2,816 bytes).
- Around a catch with a heavy NAM preset: `PK` and late blocks.

## Checked on a computer

- `tests/engine/lowoct.c` (18 checks, as the image builds the engine and with the host's defaults, also under ASan and
  UBSan): a low E gets its octave (41.2 Hz, 100 % of the output on it), a high E none; of two notes below RANGE the lower
  one's octave (E5 98 %, A5 99 %, E + A 96 %); `LOWEST`: a G chord high on the neck 98 % on the G's octave; the octave's
  attack at most 15.6 ms after the note's; the x8 upsampling's images 76 dB under the octave; COMP 100: a note 20 dB softer
  gives an octave 2.0 dB softer, hum stays at -103 dB; a 30 Hz rumble 9.6 dB under; GROWL 100: 32 % third harmonic, about
  the same level; the knobs glide; the screen texts.
- `tests/engine/pad.c` (15 checks, the same builds): a caught chord held within 2.2 dB over 10 s, at the chord's level at
  MIX 50, on its own notes; ATTACK 1.6 S: half the level after 0.92 s; a second press crosses over; RELEASE 2.7 S: -18 dB
  after 1.8 s; pressed before the strum: the ringing chord, not the pick; no clicks (largest step 0.017 against 0.138); four
  chords in quick succession; MIX and TONE turned while held; a press made before PAD was chosen is forgotten.
- Both effects give v40's output bit for bit (LOW OCTAVE 48 runs, PAD 24: settings, block sizes 64, 48, 16 and 1, knob
  turns, catches, a stop).
- `tests/ownfx_equiv.sh`: every existing model in this image's engine against the same engine without `PX_OWN_FX`, 5,460
  runs bit for bit (every block x model x 8 settings, random chains, NAM chains through the two cores' pipeline, the 52
  factory presets, every delay over a TIME x FEEDBACK x TONE x WOW grid, turned while playing and at the top for 6 s, every
  drive over 625 knob settings).
- `tests/uisim.c` built for this image: v42's 48 screens byte for byte, the PAD's 16 footswitch gestures above, every value
  text within its box, both pages drawn whole. `tests/midiio.c`: CC 64.
- The engine's tests built as the image builds it: 2,551 configurations with no NaN, 243 long runs (the same 7 delays at
  FDBK 100 hold on as without the effects), the two cores' pipeline.
- Without `PX_OWN_FX`, `engine/px_dsp.c` and `firmware/openpocket.c` preprocess to v42's text for the release, the BLE and
  the Bluetooth flags, and the simulator's WebAssembly sources too: those images are unchanged.
